the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a 
user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development 
is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so 
the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.`;
